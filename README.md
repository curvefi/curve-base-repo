# Curve Repository Template

This is a Curve repository template preconfigured for:

- Continuous integration with [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)
- Standardized testing environments with [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox)
- Linting checks using [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort)
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting hooks

The aim of this template is to ensure commonality between Curve repositories, specifically with regards to repository structure and code style.

This template is based on the [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project template [`github-action-mix`](https://github.com/brownie-mix/github-actions-mix), which should be referred to for installation details of the project's dependencies.
